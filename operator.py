#Generally operator is a specific symbolsthat helps us to perform operation
#Examples- +,-,*,/,%,**,// >,<,>=,<=,==,!=
#types Arithmetic and relational/conditional and assignment operator(=)



# a = 8 # =sign is assignent operator
# b = 4
# c = 2

# sum = a+ b + c
# product = a *  b * c
# diff = a - c
# div = a / b
# pow = b**c
# quo = a//c 20//2 =10
# mod = 9 % b  (remainder)

# print("Sum is:", sum)
# print("product is:", product)
# print("Difference is:", diff)
# print("Division is:", div)
# print("power is:", pow)
# print("quotient is:", quo)
# print("mod is:", mod)



#<,>,<=,>=,==,!=
# a=5
# b = 3 
# c = 7

# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)
# print(a==c)
# print(a!=c)
# print(a<=b)
# print(a>=b)




#Formatted string

name = "Anish"
age = 28
email = "seeyouanish@gmail.com"

print("My name is ",name , ". My age is ",age , ". My email is ", email )
print(f"My name is {name}. My age is {age}. My email is {email}.")

#"f" is syntax for formatted string.
